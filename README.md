# Library App with configCat Feature flag

This is a simple library app where you can add books to a list and clear the list if necessary.
The list is maintained in the browser's Local storage so refreshing is possible.

The feature flag sets the Sorted Mode.

Default Mode: the books are displayed in the order they were added.
Sorted Mode: the books are displayed from newest to oldest.
